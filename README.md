# Solarkraft

Solarkraft is a runtime monitoring tool for [Soroban][], powered by [TLA+][] and [Apalache][].

We have finished the activation phase and developed an MVP.

### Project Details

Solarkraft is a tool for runtime monitoring of [Soroban smart contracts][Soroban]. It tests whether a smart contract conforms to its specification during contract development, testing, and after contract deployment on the [Stellar blockchain][Stellar]. The contract specification is written as an ensemble of [TLA+][] specifications, each capturing a property of the contractâ€™s expected behavior.

Solarkraft inspects invocations of the timelock contractâ€™s methods in the history of Stellar transactions. Whenever Solarkraft finds a deviation from the expected behavior (as prescribed by the monitor specifications) it reports a monitoring alert. Importantly, monitors are small snippets of code, not an entire specification. This makes them more accessible formal artifacts than usual.
