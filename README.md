# Solarkraft

Solakraft is a runtime monitoring tool for Soroban, powered by TLA+ and
Apalache.

This project is in the proposal stage. We will add more details later.
In the meantime, you could check our [idea][] on how Solarkraft could find
a mismatch between the contract behavior and the expected behavior,
as captured by a monitor in TLA+.
