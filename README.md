# Solarkraft

Solarkraft is a runtime monitoring tool for [Soroban][], powered by [TLA+][]
and [Apalache][].

This project is in the proposal stage. We will add more details later.
In the meantime, you could check our [idea][] on how Solarkraft could find
a mismatch between the contract behavior and the expected behavior,
as captured by a monitor in TLA+.
